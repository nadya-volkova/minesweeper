# Minesweeper Game

## Description
This web application implements the classic game "Minesweeper," where players must uncover safe cells while avoiding hidden mines. The game features a customizable grid and allows players to flag suspected mines.

## How It Works
1. **Game Board Generation**: Upon loading the application, a grid is created based on specified dimensions, with a percentage of cells designated as mines.
2. **Cell Interaction**: Players can click on cells to reveal them. If a mine is triggered, the game ends, and all mines are displayed.
3. **Flagging Mines**: Players can right-click on cells to place or remove flags on suspected mines.
4. **Mine Count**: Each cell displays a number indicating how many adjacent mines are present, helping players strategize their moves.
5. **Winning Condition**: The game is won when all safe cells are revealed and all mines are correctly flagged.
